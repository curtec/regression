# Regression
This a just a breif introduction to pandas, enough to make use of this libaray within your next machine learning project. It is not intended to be a complete tutorial of pandas.
I will be using the (SECOND HAND CARS DATA SET | REGRESSION (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankpatel14/second-hand-used-cars-data-set-linear-regression/)) csv from kaggle that I have renamed to carPrices.csv for simplicity.
